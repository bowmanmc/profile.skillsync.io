            <h2>Howdy!</h2>
            <p>
                I am an experienced software architect from Dayton, Ohio with a
                focus on web-based technologies, data visualization, and user
                interface design. Through my experiences as a defense contractor
                supporting the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC)
                and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), I have led
                many large scale, technically challenging projects through design,
                development, and delivery. My experience in a wide variety of
                software technologies and agile development techniques have enabled
                me to excel both as a developer and as a team lead. In addition to
                my day job at Applied Information Sciences, I also teach Computer
                Science courses to evening students at Sinclair Community College,
                and am the lead organizer for the Dayton Data Visualization users
                group.
